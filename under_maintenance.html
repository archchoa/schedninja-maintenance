  <title>SchedNinja - Under Maintenance</title>

<body>
  <h1>Under Maintenance</h1>
  <p>SchedNinja will be under temporary maintenance. Our site has been up since 2012. However,
  our technology has stayed the same since 2012. Just this month, our hosting's servers
  upgraded to new technology. Thus, our site became incompatible with the new servers.</p>
  <p>This caused our site to crash and not work anymore. Thus, we have decided to put our site
  on hiatus for the meantime, as we work on coding a new and improved version from scratch.
  Rest assured, your accounts will still be intact when we return.</p>
  <p>We are not sure as to when we will be back. We are both busy corporate slaves, but we will
  give time in putting SchedNinja back up, because we owe you big time. If we are to give an
  estimate, expect us to be back in <strong>one or two trimesters</strong>. Stay tuned.</p>
  <p>Again, we are sorry for the inconvenience. We truly are.</p>
  <p>Regards,</p>
  <p>SchedNinja Team</p>
